# Fully-Automated-Scalable-CI-CD-Pipeline-for-Serverless-Django-on-AWS

This architecture represents a fully automated and scalable CI/CD pipeline for a Django application on AWS using rolling updates for seamless deployments. The process begins with a developer pushing code from VS Code to GitHub, which triggers Jenkins on an EC2 instance to automate the build and deployment workflow. Jenkins pulls the latest code, builds a Docker image, and pushes it to Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR). AWS ECS (Fargate) then pulls the updated image and deploys it within containers running Django on port 8000, dynamically managed by an Application Load Balancer (ALB), which routes HTTP (80) traffic securely to HTTPS (443). The application interacts with an Amazon RDS database, with logs centrally monitored via CloudWatch. Route 53 manages domain resolution, ensuring seamless traffic distribution. Rolling updates are used with a minimum of 100% running tasks and a maximum of 200% to guarantee zero downtime. This setup enables automated deployments, high availability, and scalability, ensuring a secure, efficient, and fully optimized DevOps pipeline with minimal manual intervention. ðŸš€
